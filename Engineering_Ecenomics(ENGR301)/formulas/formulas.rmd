# Linear Interpolation

$y=y_{1} + (\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}})(x-x_{1})$

# Time Estimate 

TE = (a+4m+b)/6

# Labour Cost

To calculate direct labour cost just multiply all the values together.

# Power-Sizing Model
$\frac{Size of A}{Size of B}=(\frac{Capacity of A}{Capacity of B})^{x}$

where:

* x is the power size index
* Size is often cost
* Capacity is often weight, or price index

# Learning Curve

$T_{N}$=$T_{1}$$X^{b}$

where:

* $T_{N}$ is the time needed to produce the Nth unit
* $T_{1}$ is the time needed to produce the 1st unit
* X is the number of units(total produced)
* b=$\frac{\log(learning rate)}{\log(2)}$

# Project Control

## Terminology
* **BCWS**/**PV** : Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled / Planned Value
* **BCWP**/**EV** : Budgeted Cost of Work Performed / Earned Value
* **ACWP**/**AC** : Actual Cost of Work Performed / Actual Cost
* **BAC** : Budget at Completion
* **CV** : Cost Variance
  + positive means under budget
  + negative means over budget
* **CPI** : Cost Performance Index
  + greater than one means under budget
  + smaller than one means over budget
* **SV** : Schedule Variance
  + positive means ahead of schedule
  + negative means behind schedule
* **SPI** : Schedule Performance Index
  + greater than one means ahead schedule
  + smaller than one means behind schedule
* **ETC** : Estimated [cost] to completion
* **EAC** : Estimated [cost] at completion

Note that EV and PV will be at the same value only if the project is completed.

# Earned Value

## EV, PV

* EV = %Work Completed x BAC 
* PV = %Work Scheduled x BAC

## Evaluating Factors

### Cost

* CV = EV - AC
* CPI = EV/AC

### Schedule

* SV = EV - PV
* SPI = EV/PV

## Revised Budget and Schedule

### Estimated Cost to Completion (Revised Budget)

* *typical inefficiency* ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI
* *atypical inefficiency* ETC = (BAC - EV)

EAC = ETC + AC

### Revised Schedule 

revised duration = planned duration/SPI

# Time Value of Money

## Nominal vs Effective Interest 
* Nominal interest rate(APR) **(r)** : rate per year + Usually per year and we don't use this for calculations.  
* Effective interest rate(EAR) **$i_{a}$** : rate per year factoring in compound 
  + $\frac{r}{m}$
  + Could be months, days, whatever the fuck.  
  + $i_{a}$=$(1+\frac{r}{m})^{n}$–1 
  + where m is the number of compounding periods and r is the interest rate per period.  
  + n is the compounding periods to come up with the compounding period for the EAR (can be m).

## Simple Interest

F=Pn(1+in)

where:

* F is the new amount
* P is the inital amount
* i is the interest rate
* n is the number of units

## Compound Interest
F=P(1+i)$^{n}$

where:

* F is the future amount
* P is the initial amount
* i is the interest rate
* n is the number of units

1>3 * 3>4 = 1>4

## Compound Factors
### Future Value of P
F=P(1+i)$^{n}$=P(F/P,i,n)

### Future Value of $1
$\frac{F}{P}$=(1+i)$^{n}$

### Present Value of F
P=$\frac{F}{(1+i)^{n}}$

### Present Value of $1
$\frac{P}{F}=(1+i)^{n}$

## Value of annuity

$F = A[1+(1+i)+(1+i)^{2} + ...(1+i)^{n-2}+(i+1)^{n-1}]$

or simplified

$F=\frac{A[(1+i)^{n}-1]}{i}$

where

* A is the anual installment
* F is the future value
* n is the number of years * i is the interest rate

### Never-ending Annuity

$P=\frac{A}{i}$

# Arithmetic Gradient Series of Cash Flows
![](/home/adrientremblay/Documents/school/summer\ 2020/ENGR\ 301/formulas/p1.png)

better formula using table vals

P=A($\frac{P}{A}$,i%,n)+G($\frac{P}{G}$,i%,n)

A=G($\frac{A}{A}$,i%,n)+G($\frac{A}{G}$,i%,n)

can also be A/G ??? for arithmetic gradient *uniform* series

# Geometric Gradient Series

*If i != g*

P = $A_{1}\frac{1-(1+g)^{n}(1+i)^{-n}}{i-g}$

*If i = g*

P = $A_{1}$ [n ÷ (1 + i)]

where:

* P is the present worth 
* r is the interest rate
* g is the growth rate
* n is the time period
* $A_{1}$ is the [initial] annual payment



# Capitalized Cost

**Capitalized cost(P)** is the sum of money needed to forever obtain exactly the payment amount needed(A) forever at a particular interest rate(i).

# Capital Recovery Formula (Annual Cash Flow - Salvage)

* EUAC = P(A/P, i, n) – S(A/F, i, n)

OR

* EUAC = (P – S)(A/F, i, n) + Pi

OR

* EUAC = (P – S)(A/P, i, n) + Si

## Infinite analysis

P=A/i

($\frac{A}{P}$,i,infinity) = i

# Present Worth analysis  NPW(Net Present Value)

NPW = the present value at t=0 lmao

* when doing NPW analysis we choose the plan with the **MAX** NPW
* **ALWAYS** choose a GCM analysis period!

# Annual cash flow analysis

* No need to find an equal analysis period

# Rate of Return (IRR)

Interest rate when annual benefits are equivalent to annual cost.

* EUAB = EUAC

*or*

Interest rate when PW = 0.

* If i gives a result to high go down and vice versa

## Rate of Return(IRR) between two plans

* Compute $EUAB_{A-B}$ with an i to reach 0

## Incremental Analysis

* Means of comparing different invenstements based on IRR.

For incremental IRR choose alternative with higher initial cost if IRR > MARR

For **Aya's Method**:

* Order projects from left to right most expensive to least
* start comparing pairs from the right
* if the delta IRR is greater than MARR than the more expensive project is better and the losers should be elimenated
* continue until there is a winner

# Benefit-Cost Ratio Analysis

EUAB/EUAC > 1 then accept otherwise reject

deltaEUAB/deltaEUAC < 1 then pick the trailer otherwise the leader

# Depreciation 

$BV_{t} = BV_{t-1} - D_{t}$

$D_{t} = BV_{t-1} - BV_{t}$

$BV_{t}=BV_{0} - \sum_{i=1}^{t} D_{t}$

## Straight-Line Depreciation

$d_{1} = (B-S)/N$

where:
* B is the $BV_{0}$
* S is the salvage value
* N is the useful life of the asset

## Sum Of Years Digits Depreciation (SOYD)

$d_{t}=\frac{N-t+1}{SOYD}(B-S)$

where:

* $d_{t}$ is the depreciation charge in any year t
* N is the number of years in depreciable life
* SOYD = N(N+1)/2 is sum of year's digits
* B is the cost of the asset made ready for use
* S is the estimated salvage value after depreciable life

## Declining Balance

### Normal Declining Balance

$BV_{t} = B(1-d)^{t}$

$d = 1-n\sqrt{\frac{S}{p}}$

where:

* d is the depreciation % rate
* **that's an nth root buster**

### Double Declining Balance

$d_{t}=(\frac{2}{N})(BV_{t-1})$

where:

* BV is Book Value

### CCA (Capital Cost Allowance) rate

$UCC_{t}=UCC_{t-1}-CCA_{t}$

$CCA_{t}=dUCC_{t-1}$

$UCC_{t}=B(1-d/2)(1-d)^{n-1}$

* as long as n > 1

where:

* UCC is BV aka Book Value (CRA Terminology)
* CCA is the depreciation amount
* d is the depreciation rate



**Note:** You are only allowed to claim 50% of your depreciation on year 1!
