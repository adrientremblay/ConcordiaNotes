# Lecture 2

## Technological Determinism
* History is a linear progression of technological development.
  + Certain technologies are bound to be developed(inevitable).
* Technology in a society is the primary determinant for how life is organized.
* Changes in technology leads to transformations in how society is organized.

Technology -> Society

"The windmill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam mill, society with the industrial capitalist" - Karl Marx

* Critiques:
  + Internet involved human agency and descision.
  + Some internet-like systems predated it.

## Social Determination of Technology
* Social groups produced these technologies for these use.
  + Company owners and workers formed factory.
* Hard to defend because doesn't account for how society is shaped by technology.

Society -> Technology

## Co-Production (brief)
* Soft of position of both.
* Mutual influence.

## Co-Production of technology and society
* Do artifacts have politics? - *common responses*
  + Objects don't have politics, they are neutral.  They can be used for good or bad depending on the people that use them: **Social Determination of Technology**
  + Modern technologies like internet bring democracy, or nuclear power brings authoriatarian governance: **Technolical Determenism**

## Technical design and social effect
* Langdom Winner (author of reading) critizes both.  Because both matter : you must take a soft framing of both.
  + He says some objects can be designed to have political properties, *but not all objects are political*.
* Robert Moses racist bridges and roads example:
  + Racist society influencing the design of technology which in turn then affects society. 
* Tomato harverster example:
  + Inceased efficiency but also concentrated wealth in the rich.

## Engineered systems that are strongly compatible with certain political relationships
* Solar energy is compatible with democracy.
  + *not that the two are co-requisites*.
* Nuclear energy is more compatible with authoratarianism.  

# Lecture 4 - Indigenous Peoples

## Kanien'kehae:ka Territory
* Montreal is located on unceded Mohawk land.
* Kanien'kehae:ka was an agarian society.
* First contact : 1534 - Jaques Cartier.
* Kahnawake was founded as a Jesuit village for Mohawk converts in 1667.
* Prior to 1889 the traditional governance was operated by a council of seven chiefs that were the heads of their respective clans.
  + This government continued to exists as a shadow organization.
* Traditional political structure was maintaiend until the Indian act of 1876.
  + Indians and their lands are the responsibility of Canada.
  + Created system of band elected chiefs and councils.

## Analysis of Justification of Colonial Occupation of Land
* Indian reserves account for just 0.02% of the land.
* **Doctorine of discovery:** Papal order(1452) for stealing non Christian people's land
* **Terra Nullius:** Native populations are not full human beings.  They are not being used productively.
  + Racist logic.
  + Did not consider local culture or systems of governance.

## Colonialism and Technology
* **Colonialism:** domination and dispossession between an indigenous majority and a colonizer minority.
  + Mechanism for exploiting the reosurces and labour of the native population.
  + Historically occured extensively since 1492, but is still ongoing.
* *Colonialism of rule*: ruling a population without the intention of permanent settlement.  
  Ex: British rule of India.
* *Settler Colonialism:* logic of elimination of native population and way of their life.
* Does colonialism bring development, law, education (railways)? or have negative social effects (railways were made to steal resources).
* **CPR Bridge between Kahnawake and Mtl (1887)**
  + Kahnawake not consulted.
  + Intended for railway not pedestrians, Mohawks walking to work banned.
  + Appropriated land from Kahnawake.  Similair appropriatons for Mercier bridge.
  + Benifited Canadian Pacific Railway
  + Promoted central form of life and property.
* **Oka Crisis**
  + Standoff in Kanesatake for 91 days.
  + Oka municipality made plans to extend a golf course into a sacred bureil ground.  
  + Kahnawake supported by blocking the Mercier bridge.
  + Issue was larger and issued 
  + Arthur Manuel claims that these demonstrations show that Indigeous people refuse to accept that Canada had moral grounds to take their land.
* Conflict of values
  + Settlers see land as a commodity.
  + Indigenous people see land as a relationship.

# Lecture 5 - Race as Technology
* Race and Technology are coproduced?
* Most Canadians think the relations are good.
* Visible minorities earn on average 80cents per dollar made by a white person.
* Visible minorities with a uni degree make 87cents per dollar made by a white person.
* Black, Indigenous, and Arab people are 4x likely to be stopped by police in Mtl.
* Black people are 20x more likely to be killed by police in Toronto.
* 30% of the prison population is indigenous, but only 5% of the population is.
* How to explain wage gap:
  + Problem in communities.  Cannot explain wage gap for uni degrees.
  + Bad apples or insitution?

  + But racism is more sneaky.
* Racism describes an ideology that organizes society through racial categories and social hierarchies.

# Lecture 6 - Automation and Society
* Everything comes from a market in capitalism.
  + Was this always the case?

* **Capitalist:** people who have capital.
  + Make money through surplus wealth generated by workers.
  + Increase profit by increasing productivity.  *Drives innovation?*
* Examples of automation increasing productivity:
  + Scanner in grocery store.
  + McDonald booth.
  + Division of labour -> production line.
  + Pampers.
* What are the ideas behind the ways we talk about automation?
  + "Robots are killing jobs" - Technological Determenism.
  + "Businesses are using robots to increase productivity" - Social Determenism.
  + "capitalists are using robots to get richer" 

# Lecture 7 - Gender and Technology Coproduced
* Gender pay gap.
  + Less leadership roles, tech jobs.
* Women do less paid work, but more unpaid work.
  + In total more work than men.
* Is the gap caused by society, biology, or tech?
* Gender norms, divisions, relations and technology related.
* Gender shapes technology.
  + Engineering is 'masculine'.
  + Tech is often designed for men and their interests. 
  + Prototypes consider the average WHITE male as the baseline.
  + Danger for pregnant women.
* Technology shapes gender.
  + Tech has social affects.
  + Dyson vacuum toy.
* Do robots have gender?
  + Why are personal assistants female???  WHOAHHH.
* Microwave designed for men but appropriated by women.
* Techno-feminism
  + Analyses the co-production.
  + Inquires into men's monopoly of tech and their technological skills.
  + Gender power relations in tech.  Less oppurtunity for women to learn tech/less time given.
  + Calls for re-imagining of gender equal tech.
* 1/3 women has experiences sexual violence. 
* Missing and murdered indigenous women 16% of all female homicides but only 4% of female population.
  + Near resource extraction sites.
* Biological-Determinism.
  + Women are MEANT for the kitchen.

  + Capitalism needed manly paid work and unpaid social re-productive work.
  * Social determination of gender meant to serve the PATRIARCHY.

# Lecture 8 - The state, law, and policy 
* Innovation is human, about creativity, and foolishness.
  + not about money or government.
  + But was the iPhone a combination of many different technologies?
  + Public and government research went into this.  But Apple just reaped the profits.  * Liberal theory of the state + state functions to serve general interests of citizens.  + Market choices and elections to ensure equity in society and democracy.  + Minimal government intervention in market for creativity.  + Certain activities are prevented for individual rights.
* Critical theory of the state
  + State servers to serve the capitalist class.
  + Government is a centralization of power that enforces power through violence.
  + Funds research and innovation for business than the general population.
* The law as a contested space.
  + Which law has jurisdiction? Canada, corpiration claims, province, natives, lobby groups, political parties, band councils
* Indigenous people use band councils or protests to enforce their law.
* The court injunction is the contemporary mechanism for justifying the colonial state's dispossession of indigenous territories.

# Lecture 10 - Design Justice
* The positives of technology :)))0
* First priority of engineers is clients and society.  Personal interests and profits come second.
  + Guided by professional morals.
* Fundamental Values:
  + Competency.
  + Ethical Conduct.
  + Accountability.
  + Social Commitment.
* Capitalism, exploitation, racism, patriarchy and colonialism are potential inputs and outputs of technology

## Design Accountability
* Nothing for us without us is for us.
* Those most affected by the outcomes should lead and own digital design processes and products.
  + Were homeless people part of the design of anti-homeless benches.

## How do we code with equity?
* Much of this tech came from disabled peoples DIABOLIC DEMANDS.
* Can AI remove biases?  Or are they reproduced.
  + Sexist Amazon hiring algo.
* Breast pump not suck
  + Hackathon
